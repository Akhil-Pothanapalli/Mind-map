# Mind-map

When we learn something new, we learn them in discrete but seldom we know how these components in the big picture. My goal is to create a model that takes in text input and generates a mind map out of it. 

Why another mindmap model?
1. Market models ranks tree structure higher than graph structure. Mind maps are great because they show the interdependecies.
2. AI is used to create branches based on its knowledge, but I want the AI to create these nodes and edges based on the text provided.

I have a very little idea to manifest this. But I will gather enough resources to push this forward. 

Tips for moving forward:
How mindmaps are usaully created?
What the best/ optimal way to create a mindmap?

Future of mindmaps:
Take multimodal input.
A toggle switch to turn the computer generated words to human writing in appearance.
A slider to select the number of keywords, so the mind map can vary from simple to complex. 


Inorder to create an effective mindmap, this video helped me to initiate my journey:

The key points are 6-step mnemonic called GRIND: Grouped, Reflective, Interconnected, Non-verbal, Directional, and Emphasized.

1. Grouped: Organize your ideas into categories. This will help you see the relationships between different concepts.
2. Reflective: Your mind map should reflect how you think, not how you write linearly. Don't be afraid to experiment with different layouts.
3. Interconnected: Look for connections between different ideas, even if they seem distant at first. This will help you create a more holistic understanding of the topic.
4. Non-verbal: Use images, symbols, and doodles instead of words whenever possible. This will help you to remember information more easily.
5. Directional: Arrange your ideas in a way that shows the flow of information. This will help you to see the cause-and-effect relationships between different concepts.
6. Emphasized: Use visual cues, such as color and font size, to highlight the most important points in your mind map. This will help you to focus your attention when you are reviewing your notes.
