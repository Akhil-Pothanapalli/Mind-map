# Mind-map

When we learn something new, we learn them in discrete but seldom we know how these components in the big picture. My goal is to create a model that takes in text input and generates a mind map out of it. 

Why another mindmap model?
1. Market models ranks tree structure higher than graph structure. Mind maps are great because they show the interdependecies.
2. AI is used to create branches based on its knowledge, but I want the AI to create these nodes and edges based on the text provided.

I have a very little idea to manifest this. But I will gather enough resources to push this forward. 

Tips for moving forward:
How mindmaps are usaully created?
What the best/ optimal way to create a mindmap?

Future of mindmaps:
Take multimodal input.
A toggle switch to turn the computer generated words to human writing in appearance.
A slider to select the number of keywords, so the mind map can vary from simple to complex.
